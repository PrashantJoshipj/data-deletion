  <h1>Data Deletion Instructions</h1>
  <p>
    This page explains how users can request deletion of their data from our
    application.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Option 1:</strong> If you would like to delete your data, please email us at 
    <code>youremail@domain.com</code> with the subject line <em>"Data Deletion Request"</em>. 
    Include any details (such as your user ID) that will help us locate your data.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Option 2:</strong> If you have a user dashboard, you can go to 
    <em>“Account Settings” → “Delete My Data”</em> (if implemented).
  </p>
  <p>
    Once we receive your request, we will delete your data from our records within 
    <strong>48 hours</strong> (or your stated timeframe) and confirm with you once the process 
    is complete.
